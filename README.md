# MiniSudoku
The second iteration of my first ever OOP project 
Rebuilt from the ground up with flexibility in mind
The goal of remaking this project is separating rendering from updating
There are some screenshots of the game:

Clicking 'Solve' solves the puzzle using backtracking. Pink squares are the ones currently being tried.
If all moves are exhausted, the program stops. At any time, the new button that pops up at the top right can be pressed, which instantly solves the sudoku puzzles and removes the wrong input

Pressinge scape while solving cancels the backtracking algorithm and allows the player to continue from there on.
